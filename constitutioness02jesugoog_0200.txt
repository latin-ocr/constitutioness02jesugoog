THE conswl‘ru'nons 01¹·

the course shall ordinarily be commenced, the books to be read
being so arranged that a Student may begin on any one of the
four years3 and through the remainder of the four years com-
menced, and of so much of the four years to follow, down to
the period corresponding to the term when he began, he may
complete a course of Theology in four years.

In the degrees as well of Masters of Arts, as of Doctors of
Divinity, let three things be observed: First, let no one be
advanced until he be diligently and publicly examined by persons
appointed, who shall carefully perform this duty, and he shall be
found qualified for that Science, whether he belong to the
Society, or not; Secondly, That the door may be closed against
Ambition‚ no fixed places shall be assigned to those who are
raised to Degrees; but let them rather study in honour to
prefer one another, without observing any difference of places:
Thirdly, As the Society instructs gratuitously, so let it raise to
degrees gratuitously; and to those without the Society, let very
little expense, although voluntary, be permitted, lest custom at
length obtain the force of law ; and in this point in the course
of time they exceed moderation. Let the Rector take care also
not to permit the Masters, or any others of the Society to re-
ceive, for themselves or the College, money, or any gift from any
one for anything done for his service; since the Lord Christ
alone is to be our reward, om· exceedinq qreat reward, accordinq to

our I nstitute.

CHAP. XVI.

Lm· diligence be used that they who come to the Universities
of the Society to study literature, acquire also good morals
worthy of Christiana: to which it will greatly assist‚ if all go
to the sacrament of Confession at· least once a mouth, and hear
Mass every day, and a Sermon every holy-day, when one is*
preached. And each of the Preceptors will take care that this
be done by his pupils,

The Catechism shall be rehearsed in College, on a certain day of
every week, and care shall be taken that boys shall learn and
repeat it, and that all of more advanced age, if possible, may
know it.
