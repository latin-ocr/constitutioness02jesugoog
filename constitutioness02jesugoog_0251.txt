the administration of the Sacmments, or in short for any spiria
tual concerns (as is declared in the Sixth Part), nor applying
the incomes of the Colleges to their own use.

6 It will be also of great importance for the perpetual preservatiOn
of the Society in its prosperous condition most diligently to
remove ambition, the mother qf all evils in every commonwealth
and society, and to preclude all approach to dignity‚ and the
seeking of any preferment in the Society directly or indirectly.
To effect this, let all the Professed vow to God and our Lord

spontaneously be bound in the sight of God to do that which
he shall perceive to be best for God's service3 and that ke is
happy there is any one to propose it in charity and Christian liberty
to the glory of God and our Lord.

Second, and Fifth Part, of not admitting a multitude of men
useless to our Institue, to probation even; and of dismissing
such as during probation are found to be unfit.

9 But if any are discovered of depraved morals‚ and of whose
amendment little hope can be felt, still less shall these be
retained. The admission to be approved Scholars and Coad-
