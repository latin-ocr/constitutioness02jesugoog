of the Lord: that is, whether the Holy Spirit Who guides them,
promises to them so much grace, that they may hope with His
assistance to sustain the burden of this vocation ε and when, by the
inspiration of God, they have enrolled their name in this warfare of
JESUS Christ, their loins should be girded night and day, and they
should be ready for the discharge of so great a debt. And that
there may be no secking or refusing among ourselves of missions
or provinces of any kind, let each profess that he will never-directly
or indirectly solicit any thing of the Roman Pontiff touching such
missions: but refer all this care to God, and the Pontiff as his
Vicar, and to the General of the Society. The General also shall
profess, like the rest, that he will not solicit of the said Pontiff
touching his own mission into any part, except with the con-
currence of the Society. All shall vow that they will be obedient
to the Head of tlie Society in all things which tend towards the

according to the circumstances of personS, placeS‚ and times. For
it is most necessary that the General and his council diligently
watch over the management of this business; seeing that the
edifice of saith cannot be raised in our neighbours without a
foundation, and there may be danger among ourselveS, lest, as each
shall be more learned he may endeavour to evade this duty, as at
first sight perhaps less engaging: whilst in fact none is more
productive, either of edification to our neighbour, or of the prac-
tice of the duties of charity and humility to ourselveS. Inferiors
moreover shall be always bound to obey the General in' all things
pertaining to the Institute of the Society, as well for the great
advantages of order, as for the never-to-be-sufficiently lauded
ἱ diligent exercise of humility; and shall recognize Christ, as thouqlz
. present in kim, and as far as is becoming, worship him. And since
we have experienced that a life most remote from every contagion
of avarice, and most nearly resembling evangelica] poverty is more
