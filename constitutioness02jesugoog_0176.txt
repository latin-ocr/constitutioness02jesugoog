ought, but that they remember, and practise what they learn:
let all employ their time in spiritual concerns, and persist in
acquiring habits of devotion according to the measure of the
grace of God communicated to them; to which it will greatly
contribute to assign certain or even all the spiritual exercises to
such as have not hitherto employed themselves in them; as shall
be judged most expedient for each in the Lord.

It is fit that all be practised in preaching at home (except the
Superior exempt any one) so that beyond the useful employment
of an hour after dinner, they may be encouraged and habituated
in some degree (as to voice, and manner, and other particulars)
to discharge that duty; and to give some evidence of the talent
which the Lord communicates to them in this department;
and also to express their good conceptions to their own and
their neighbours' edification, frequently treating of those subjects
which relate to self-denial, advaneement in virtue, and perfections

and above all to union and brotherly love.

It will assist greatly to discharge those duties with all possible
devotion, in which humility and charity are more especially
necessary. And generally speaking, the more closely each one
has united himself to God, and thrown himself freely upon the
supreme Majesty ; so much the more bountiful he will find God
towards him; and he will daily become more qualified to receive
grace and ampler spiritual gifts.

to him with inward reverence and affection; let them obey not

only in the outward performance of what he enjoins; entirely,
promptly, resolutely, and with all due humility‚ without excuses,
or murmurs, even though he order things hard to be done, and
repugnant to their own sense; but let them also strive to acquire
perfect resignation and denial ⁰f their own will aud jud9ment,
