means conducive to His greater service and glory to admit men
of unmanaqeable temper& or unavailable to the Society, how-
ever advantageous it might prove to the individuals.

5 It is needful that those who are admitted to aid the Society in
spiritual concernS, considering what a ministry of this nature
requires that the souls of their follow-creatures be benefited,
be furnished with these following gifts of God.

6 As regards their intellect3 of sound doctrine, or apt to learn it;
of discretion in the management of busineSS, or, at least of
capacity and judgment to attain to it.

7 As to memory3 of aptitude to perceive, and also to retain their
perceptione.

8 As to intention3 that they be studious of all virtue and spiritual
perfection; calm, stedfast, strenuous in what they undertake
for God's service; burning with zeal for the salvation of souls‚
and therefore attached to our Institute3 which directly tends to
aid and dispose the souls of men to the attainment of that
ultimate end, from the hand of God, our Creator and Lord.

9 In externals; facility of language, so needful in our intercourse
with our neighbour, is most desirable.

10 Α comely presence, for the edification of those with whom we

have to deal.

ll Good health, and strength to undergo the labours of our

Institute.

12 Age to correspond with what has been said; which, in those

admitted to probation should exceed the fourteenth year, and in
those admitted to profession the twenty-fifth.

13 As the external gifts of nobility, wealth, reputation and the

like are not sufficient, if others are wanting; so, if there be a
sufficiency of others, these are not essential: so far, however, as
they tend to edification, they make those more fit for admission,
wh0, even without them, would be eligible on account of the
qualities before mentioned3 in which, the more he excels who
desires to be admitted, so much the more fit will he be for this
Society, to the glory of God our L‘ord3 and the less he excels,
so much the less serviceable will he be. But the sacred unction
of the divine Wisdom will instruct those who undertake this
duty to His service and more abundant praise, what standard

should be maintained in all these things.
