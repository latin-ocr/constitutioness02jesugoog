ΤΗΕ CONSTITUTIONS 01²·

It will be the Rector’s duty, in the first place, to sustain, as it
were upon his shoulders, the whole College by prayer and holy
desires ; in the next, to see that the Constitutions be observed,
to watch over all the Collegians with all solicitude ; to defend
them from all that may hurt them at home and abroad, as well
by prevention‚ as by applying a remedy when mischief occurs ;
according both to the general interest and also that of the
individua] 3 by seeing that they improve in virtue and learning ;
securing their health, and likewise the property of the College
as well moveable as immoveable; prudently appointing those
who hold domestic employmentS, and observing how they dis-
charge their duty; and as he shall judge most expedient in the
Lord‚ keeping them in their placeS, or removing them: and
generally speaking, he shall see that that which has been set
forth in the previous chapters relating to the CollegeS, be
observed. Let him be mindful also of the subordination to be
entirely maintained in Obedience‚ not only to the General, but
to the Provincia] alsO, informing him of all things needful to be
communicated‚ and referring to him everything of moment;
obeying all his injunctions (seeing he also has a Superior) ; as it
is just that matters be referred to him, and obedience be yielded
by those who live in the College; who should greatly revere and
venerate their Rector, as one who holds the place of Christ our
Lord‚ leavinq to him the free disposition of themselves and their
conoerns with unfeiqned obedience; keepinq nothinq concealed from
him, not even their conscienceS, which they should disc-lose to him, as
is set forth in the Eoeamen, at tlte appointed seasonS, and oftener if
any cause require it ,· ‘not opposinq, not contradictiny, not showiny
an opinion in any case opposed to his opinion ; so that by the union
of the same sentiment and will, and by due submission, they may
the better be maintained and forwarded in the service of God.

Let the Rector provide not only the necessary number of officers
for the good management of the House, but let him see that
they are competent, as far as possible, to their employments ; to
every one let him give his regulations, containing all that relates
to their several dutieS, and see that no one intermeddle with
another’s department. Moreover, as whenever it is necessary, he
should provide assistance for them, so whenever they have time to

spare, he should see that they spend it profitably to the service
of God.
