shall determine to send uS, amongst believers or unbelievers, to
the greater glory of God and the succour of souls. Nor has
the Society had inq view any particular part3 but that it may

.. be scattered ΒΥ him in divers regions and countries throughout
the world ι seeing it would of itself select the most beneficial
course, and would expect no other, if the chief Pontiff should
direct the distribution of its memberS.

2 And on this point, since the Society has engaged every thought

possible, in writinq, that what is enjoined him may be more
exactly accomplished. The Superior will take care to assist him
with advice and instruction, as far as possible, so that he may
more usefully discharge his duty in all things to the service of
God and the Apostolic See.
