sometimes unavoidable; as to conduct the election of a General,
whether he shall be chosen instead of one deceased, or be sub-
stituted for another, who must resign his office for some one of
those reasonS, hereafter to be enumerated.

Another cause is, when they shall have to deliberate on subjects
of lasting and exceeding interest, such as for example, to dis-
solve Colleges or HouseS, or to remove them elsewhere, or other
