subsist on alms, they also shall live in the same way. If they
are Rectors of Colleges, or LecturerS‚ or useful in any other
‘necessary or advantageous employments‚ they shall live as the
others do, out of the College-revenues‚ so long as these shall
require their service. When they shall cease to be useful to the
Colleges‚ let them no longer live in them ; and they shall dwell
in the Houses of the Society, as is said of the Professed.

5 Not only shall the Houses and Churches of the Society have no
revenues‚ but not even any possessions whether peculiar or com-

which MasseS‚ or ConfessionS‚ or Sermom, or Lessom, or Visi-
tationS‚ or any other duty of all those which the Society can
render according to our Institute, may appear to be remunerated;
that so it may proceed with greater liberty and edification of our
neighbours in God’s service.

8 To avoid all appearance of covetousness‚ especially in offices of
piety which the Society discharges for the succom· of souls, let
there be no box in the church, into which alms are generally put
by those who go thither to SermonS‚ MasS‚ or Confession‚ and
other spiritual concerns.
