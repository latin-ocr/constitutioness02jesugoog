ΤΟ THE SERVICE OF· THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES.

CHAP. VIII.

l 'LooxlNG to the object to which the -studies of our Society are
dirqted it will contribute to that end, that they begin to
habituate themselves to wield their spiritual weapons for the
benefit of their neighbours. For although this should be done
in our Houses more properly and continuously‚ it should yet be

commenced 111 0111 Colleges.
2 First of all, those who in the judgment of the Superior are to

be admitted to sacred 0111315, should be instructed 111 1113 1113111011
of saying Μ355, 50 11131 besides intelligence 31111 1111311131 devo-
tion, they may exhibit a becoming external manner .to the
edification of the hearers: 31111 11131 311 1113 Society, as far as
possible, may use the same ceremonies : 111 which so far as the
variety of countries shall allow, it shall follow the Roman 11130-
tice as being more general, 31111 11131 which the Apostolic See has
adopted in 3 111013 1130111131· manner.

Let them accustom themselves also in setting forth their sermons
and sacred lectures to the way best adapted for the edification of
the people, which differs from the Scholastic method; and to
discharge this duty let them labour to acquire the vernacular
tongue of the country thoroughly. There are other things
which they should have studied‚ and have at their fingers’ 311115,
which will be useful to this duty; and in short, they should
employ all means which may assist 1113111 10 discharge this office

the better, and with greater spiritual profit to others.
Let them be accustomed also to the ministration of the Sacra-

ments of Confession and Communion, and endeavour to compre-
hend and discharge that duty not only as relates to themselves
but also to the penitents and communicants, that they may

understand and receive the same duly and usefully 10 1113 glory

of God.
Let them accustom themselves to communicate their spiritual

exercises to 0111315, when each has experienced them in himself ;

and let all be diligent not only to give an explanation of them,
but also to acquire a readiness in wielding this kind of spiritual

arms which by the grace of God is felt 10 0011111111113 50 largely

10 His service.
