troubles arisen therein‚ he invested the ordinaries with full power
and authority over the members of the orders thus suppressed,
commanding them to take the dress of the secular clergy, and
assigning them annuities out of the revenues of the suppressed
convents, granting withal the permission to enter into such other
orders as they should see fit.

The same Innocent X. having considered that no spiritual ad-
vantages could be- derived from the regular congregation of the
priests of the good J esus, did, by another brief of the 2211 of
June, 1651, abolish the same for ever. He submitted the said
regulars to the jurisdiction of their Ordinary‚ assigned them a

’ convenient portion of the revenues of the congregation, permitting

them to enter into any other approved order, and reserving to
himself the disposition of the goods of the said congregation, to
be applied as he should see fit to works of piety.

Lastly, Clement IX. our predecessor, of blessed memory, having
considered that the three regular orders of the regular canons of
St. Gregory in Alga, of the J eromites of Fiesole, and of the
J esuits instituted by St. Colombanus‚ were of no further use to the
Christian world, and that no hopes remained of rendering them
hereafter useful, resolved to abolish them, and did actually do so,
by his brief bearing date the 6th of December, 1668. With
regard to their goods and revenueS, which were vely considerable,
at the request of the republic of Venice he assigned them for the
carrying on the war of Candia against the T‘urks,

Our predecessorS‚ in taking and executing these resolutionS, have
very wisely preferred this method to all others; they regarded it
as the only one calculated to calm the agitation of men’s mindS,
and to stifle the spirit of party and dissension. They therefore
avoided the slow and fallible method of proceeding in ordinary
contestations before the courts of justice, contenting themselves to
follow the laws of prudence, and relying wholly on that plenitude qs
power which they possessed in so eminent a deqree as vic-ars qs Christ
upon earth, and as sovereiqn moderators qf the Christian republic ,-
they executed all these changes without giving the regular orderS,
which they proposed to suppress, the faculty of producing any
arguments in their defence, or of clearing themselves from the
heavy accusations brought against them, or of opposing the power-

ful motives by which the holy pontiffs were induced to take such
resolutionS.
