6 In those Colleges which, besides Preceptors, can maintain twelve

’ 3 In addition to this, they only shall be admitted among the
Approved Scholars, who have been under Probation in our
Houses and Colleges, and at the end of two years spent in
various trials and proofs, and after taking the vows, with* a
promise to enter the Society, they shall be admitted to spend
their lives within it for ever to the glory of God.

4 Besides these, some may be admitted to study, who, before the
two years,- and the probation above-mentioned, are sent to the
