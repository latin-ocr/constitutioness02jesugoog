mitted to their charge ; and the tremendous judgment with which
the great J udge of the living and the dead doth threaten those
who are invested with so high a character.

Further we will, that if any of those who have heretofore
professed the institute of the company, shall be desimus of dedi-
cating themselves to the instruction of youth in any colleye or

from which they were heretofore precluded as reqular clerks qf the
Company of Jesus.

We likewise abrogato all the prerogatives which had been
granted to them by their Genera] and other superiors, in virtue of
the privileges obtained from the Sovereign Pontiffs‚ and by which
they were permitted to read heretical and impious bookS, proscribed
