towards the conclusion of this period the Rector shall under-
stand that it is his duty to inform the General or Provincial, and
represent what proficiency they have made; and then he shall
follow whatever instructions he may receive to the glory of God.

 

01³· THE GOVERNMENT 01³· THE coLLEGES.

1 ΤΗΕ Professed Society shall have the supreme care or superin-
tendence of the Colleges according to the letters of the Apostolic
See. For since the Professed cannot apply any portion of those
revenues to their private advantage or their own use ; it is most
consonant to reason that they will proceed with greater purity
and religion more constantly and perseveringly in those things
which are necessary to the good government of the Colleges to
the greater service of God and our Lord.

2 Except what relates to the Constitutions, §and the dissolutior· or
alienation qf our Colleyes, the whole power and administrativa, and
(generally speaking) the execution of this superintendence shall
belonq to the Genera, who keeping before his eyes the object
towards which the Colleges and the Society at large are directed,
shall best perceive what is beneficial for them.

3 The General himself therefore, or some one empowered by him

‘ for this duty, shall appoint one of the Coadjutors of the Society
to preside fover each College3 who shall give an account of the
duty assigned to him to the Provincial, or whomsoever the
Genera] shall nominate. And the General also may remove the
Rector, and relieve him from his responsibility, as shall appear
to him most desirable in the Lord.

4 Care should be taken that he who undertakes the office of
Rector should be most exemplary, of great edification‚ and strict
mortification in all depraved inclinations, and tried especially in
Obedience, and in humility; one endowed with discretion, skilled
in government, versed in business, and experienced in spiritual
concerns; knowing how to interchange , severity with mildness
in due time and place, anxious, laboriouS, learned ; in short one
in whom the Superiors may confide, and to whom they may
safely communicate their power; since, the ampler this autho-
rity, the more effectually the Colleges will be directed to the
greater glory of God.
