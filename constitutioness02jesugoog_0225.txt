various regions of the world, the more diligently should the
means of maintaining that union be secured; since the Society
can neither be preserved, nor governed, nor, consequently, can
the object be attained at which it aimS‚ to the greater glory of
God3 unless its members be united among themselves, and with
their Head. We will speak therefore of those things which
relate to the usual personal union in Congregations or convents.
Now towards this union of mindS‚ some things on the part of
inferiors, some on the part of Superiors‚ some originating in
both will be conducive.

2 With regard to inferiorS‚ it will be well that no great number of
persons be admitted to Profession 3 and not every one, but select
men only should be retained among the Coadjutors or ScholarS.
For a great multitude of such as have not quite subdued their
faultS‚ as they cannot endure subordination, so neither can they
secure anion, which is so needful in Christ our Lord‚ for the
preservation of the good estate and method of proceeding of
the Society.

3 And since a great union of this sort is secured chiefly by the
hond qs Obedience; this must ever be maintained in all its vigour:
And those who are sent forth from the Houses to labour in the
Lord’s harvest, should be well exercised therein‚ as far as possi-
ble : and in this virtue, such as take the lead in the Society
should outshine the rest in their good example 3 and always in
harmony with their Superior should persovere promptly, humbly
and devotedly in their obedience to him. And if any one has
failed in giving unquestionable proof of his obedience, an asso·
ciate should always be united with him, who has been more
conspicuous therein. For, for the most part, an associate who
is more perfect in Obedience will by the divine favour therein
assist him who is less so. And otherwise, although this object
be not aimed at, a Colleague should be appointed to him who
shall be sent in any charge of government‚ if it should appear to
the Superior, that the duty thus committed to him will be better
performed 3 and the Colleague shall so behave towards him who
is over the rest, and he in turn towards his Colleague‚ that the
Obedience and reverence of the inferiors for their Superior be
not impaired: but rather that the one may find the other to
have been given to be a true and faithful assistant and supporter,
as well to himself as to those committed to his care.
