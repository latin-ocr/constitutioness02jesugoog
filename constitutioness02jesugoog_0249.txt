Grace of Almighty God and our Lord J esus Christ; in Him
alone ought our hopes to be fixed‚ that He will preserve and
promote this work which He has vouchsafed to commence to
His own service and praise‚ and the succour of souIS.
And in this hope, the first and most congruous means will be
those of prayers and sacrifices, which with this holy intention
ought to be offered, and settled in a fixed succession, through
the several weeks‚ months and yearS, in al] those places where
the Society resides,

Society, that is, of things external, but of the spirit als0, and
for fulfilling the object which it proposes to itself, the succour
of souls, those means of attaining its ultimate and supernatural
end are the more efficacious which unite the instrument with
God, and dispose it to be well directed, by the divine hand,
than those which connect it with mankind. Of this sort are
probity and virtue, and above all charsty, and a pure intention
of serving God, and a familiarity with God in spiritual exercises
of devotion, and a sincere zeal for 8οιι18, to the glory of Him
