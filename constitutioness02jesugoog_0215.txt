Superior ; whether it be to their' own improvement and edifica-
tion, or of others, among whom they live.

Since those occupatione which are undertaken for the succour of
souls are of great moment, and peculiar to our Institute‚ and
very frequent; and since moreover our dwelling is so uncertain
in one place or another; our members shall not serve the Choir
at canonical hourS, or the saying of Masses or other offices ε as
there will be abundant opportunity for them who are led by
devotion to hear them to satisfy themselves, But that should
be attended to by us which is more agreeable to our calling to

· the glory of God.

Sincelikewise the members of this Society should always be
prepared to go to any quarter of the globe‚ to which they shall
be sent by the Pope, or their Superiors 3 they should not under-
take the care of souls, nor of ReligiouS‚ or any other women
whatsoever, so as commonly to hear their ConfessionS, or direct
them3 although there is no objection to their receiving the Con-
fessions of a Monastery once and for special reasons.

It is by no means right for them to be bound to say perpetual
Masses in their ChurcheS, or to any similar duty, which the

liberty necessary to om· method of proceeding in the Lord does
not allow of.

That the Society may be at greater leisure for spiritual concerns
according to its Institute; let them abstnin, as far as possible,
from secular affairS, such as the making of wills, executorshiPS,
or the management of civil business, or duties of that kind ι nor
undertake them, nor allow themselves to be occupied with them
under any urgency of entreaty. And if any affairs of the
Colleges require attention, let them have their own proctorS‚ to
manage them, and uphold their rights But if they concern
the Houses of the Society, or its whole body; that the Society
may better maintain its tranquillity‚ the same proctor may
defend its rights, or some one of the CoadjutorS, or some one
even without the Society, or some Family, which shall take

upon itself the patronage of the House‚ to the greater glory of
God.
For the same reason, and that occasions of disturbance contrary

to our profession may be avoided, and peace and good-will be
better maintained with all, to the greater glory of God, no one of
the Professed, or Coadjutors‚ or even Scholars of the Society
