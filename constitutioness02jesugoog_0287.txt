beginning with the words Dominus ae Redemptor Noster, issued
under the seal of the Fisherman, on the 22d of J uly, 1773, which
we expressly abrogate as far as contrary to the present order.

itself, provided they have the signature of some notary public,
and the seal of some ecclesiastica] dignitary3 that no one be
permitted to infringe, or by an audaeious temerity to oppose any part ,
qf this ordinant-e ; and that should any one take upon him to
attempt it, let him know that he will thereby incur the indignation
of Almighty God‚ and of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul.

Given at Rome, at Sancta Maria Major, on the 7 th of

August, in the year of our Lord 1814, and the
l5th of our Pontificate.
