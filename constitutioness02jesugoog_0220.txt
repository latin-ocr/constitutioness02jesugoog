THE CONSTITUTIONS 01¹·

remain there for three months, more or less, according to the
measure of the spiritual advantage which may be derived from
thence, or hoped for elsewhere; or in short, as it shall be con-
sidered most conducive to the general benefit. All which shall
be conducted at the Superior’s determination, who shall regard
the Pope's sacred intention for the service of Christ our Lord.
When he shall continue longer in these appointed places, if it
may be done without detriment to the principal mission, and the
object of the Pope, it will not be improper to make excursions‚
if possible, and if he shall think them likely to be beneficial to
God’s service3 so that contributing to the succour of souls in
the neighbourhood, after a while he may return to the place of
his own residence ; in which also besides the business especially
enjoined him (on which he shall bestow his best endeavours,
and never neglect for other occupations however useful in the
service of God) he may and ought to consider in what other
objects conducive to the glory of God and the salvation of souls
he may employ his efforts without detriment to his mission, as
said before. He shall not allow any opportunity to escape,
which God shall grant him, so far as he shall think expedient.
The better to secure the object of our profession and promise,
whenever a new Vicar of Christ shall be elected to the Apos-
tolic See, within a year from his creation and coronation the
General either by himself or by another shall be obliged to
declare to his Holiness the profession and express ⁵promise of
Obedience‚ by which the Society has bound itself by its peculiar
Vow regarding missions to the glory of God.

many places with the greater facility and security of those who
are appointed to this duty, the Generals of the Society according
to the power granted them by the Pope, may send whomsoever
they will of the Society, wheresoever they shall judge most
expedient3 wh0, nevertheless‚ wherever they may be, shall be
prepared to obey the Apostolic See. And since there are many
who may solicit some members of our Society to be allowed
