laesioniS, nor in short any pretext or motive, however just, reason-
able, or privileged, not even though the omission of such form or
point should be of such a nature aS, without the same being
expressly guarded against, would render every other act invalid.
For all this notwithstanding, our will and pleasure is, that these
our letters should for ever and to all eternity be valid, pemanent,
and efficaciam, have and obtain their full force and effect, and be
inviolably observed by all and every whom they do or may concern,
now or het-easter, in any manner whatever.

In like manner, and not otherwise, we ordain that all the matters
here above specified, and every of them, shall be carried into
execution by the ordinary judge and delegate, whether by the
auditor, cardinal, legate ὰ latere, nuncio, or any other person who
haS, or ought to have, authority or jurisdiction in any matter or
suits, taking from all and every of them all power of interpreting
these our letters. And this to be executed‚ notwithstanding all
constitutionS, privilegeS, apostolic commands, &c. &c. &c. And
though to render the abolition of these privileges legal they should
have been cited word for word, and not comprised only in general
clauses, yet for this time, and of our special motion, we do derogate
from this usage and custom, declaring that all the tenour of the
said privileges is, and is to be supposed, as fully expressed and
abrogated as if they were cited word for word, and as if the usual
form had been observed.

Lastly, our will and pleasure is, that to all copies of the present
Brief, signed by a notary public, and sealed by some dignitary of
the Church, the same force and credit shall be given as to this
original.
