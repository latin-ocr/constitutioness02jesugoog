established. He determined‚ als0‚ that whoever was disposed to
found any new religious house, should submit it to some of the
rules or institutions already approved. From hence it results that
no one has a right to found any new order, without the special
permission of the Roman pontiff, aud that with very good reason ;
the rather, as the end of the new institutions being the attainment
of a greater degree of perfection, it is proper that the Apostolic
See should previously and carefully examine the rules of conduct
proposed to be laid down, lest great inconveniencies, and even
scandaIS, should be introduced into the church of God, under the
specious appearance of a greater good.

Notwithstanding the wisdom of these dispositions of Innocent
ΙΙΙ. in after times exc-ess of importunity wrunq from the Holy
See the approbation of divers regular orders; nay, such was the
arroyant tenoerity of many individuals, that an infinite number of

See should appoint. He prohibited likewise the members of the said
orders to preach, confess, or even inter any other dead except those
of their own order. He declared, however, that the orders and
preachers called “Fratres Minores,'' should be exempted from this
constitution, inasmuch as the evident advantage the Catholic church
reaped from them, entitled them to an entire approbation. He
