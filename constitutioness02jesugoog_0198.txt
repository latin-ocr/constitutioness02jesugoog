of the lectures; see that they are repeated, and that the
Students in Humanity cultivate their conversational powerS,
speaking Latin and improving their style by writing : enjoining
frequent disputationS‚ and especially on the superior students;
for which certain days and hours shall be appointed, when they
shall debate‚ not only with their equaJS, but the inferior with the
more advanced on subjects of their own selection; which also in
turn the more advanced shall do with the less forward, descend-

and the Preceptors with one another, due moderatiori being
maintained, and a President appointed, to break off the debate,
and to declare what doctrine should be elicited from the discus-

intellect should endeavour to advance in all, and become con-
spicuous to the glory of God.

5 As assiduity in literary pursuits is necessary, so is some relaxa-
tion also, Although it shall be left to the Rector to consider
what this should be, and at what periods‚ the circumstances of

persons and places being attended tc.
