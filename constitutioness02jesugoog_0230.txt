l Tan place where the society shau meet for the eiection of a

General should commonly be the Court of the Pope, where for
the most part shall be the residence of the General; except the
Society shall deliberately determine that it should assemble in
some other place, more convenient for all 3 as if a place should
be appointed ‚ in the confines of various Provinces where the
Society dwells, or any other, which shall appear more proper.
If it is the General who summons the Society for other busi-

ness: he shall select and appoint the place which he shall think
best in the Lord.

The time which shall be allowed to assemble the Society for the
election of a Genera] shall be five or six months from the date
of the letters written to give notice of it. And this period may
be extended in case of necessity. But when it shall be sum-

his own pleasure.

This method shall be observed in convoking the Society: the
person whose duty it is shall immediately inform the Provincials
in various ways, and such of the Professed as are specially
summoned, assigning the cause, as far as shall seem sufficient to
him, the place and time of the meeting, and recommending also
that masses be celebrated and prayers offered everywhere, for
the favourable election of the General. Every Provincial (not
having the power of the selection in himself) shall convene the
Professed residing within his Province, the Rectors also and
local Superiors who can assemble without great inconvenience.
When they are collected in provincial congregation, they shall

,elect such as are to be sent to the general meeting by a majority

of votes, the Provincial having two. These ought to be such
as it shall be most expedient to send to the congregation, and
