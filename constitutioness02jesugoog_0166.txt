in number; so ought those to be dismissed who are not so;
and of whom it may appear, in the course of time, either that
that this is not their calling, or that it is not to the common
interest of the Society that they continue in it. But as we
ought not to be too easy in granting admission3 s0, still less
should we be too free in dismissing3 but proceed with all con-
sideration and circumspection in the Lord. And although it is
proper that the causes deserving dismissal be the more weighty,
in proportion to the closeness of the individual's connexion with
the body of the Society; still, however intimately he may be
united, in certain cases he may and ought to be removed3 as
will appear in the following chapter..

The power of dismissal belongs, in the first place, to the Society
at large, when it may assemble in general Congregation. It is
vested also in the General in all cases excepting those con-

power be conferred; and in due proportion, als0, upon local
Superiors and Rectors of collegeS‚ in cases where it shall seem
fit ; that thus, throughout the body of the Society, the sub-
ordination qf holy Obedience be better maintained3 whereby
inferiors may more distinctly understand that they depend upon
their immediate superiors, and that it is highly expedient, and

even necessary, to obey them in all things, for the sake of
Christ our Lord.

CHAP. II.

Tun prudent charity of the Superior who has this power should
weigh before the Lord the causes which may justify the dis-

missal of any one; but generally speaking, there seem to be
four kinds of them.

First3 if it should appear in the Lord to be contrary to His
honour and glory, that an individual should continue in this
Society, who seems to be incorrigible in any depraved affections
or vices offensive to the divine Majesty; which should be the
less tolerated, the more serious and culpable they are : and that
