(forasmueh as we pay obedient-e to His place, and for His love and
reverence) leaving every other thing, not staying to finish a
letter even which the pen is tracing, in our eagerness for instant
compliance: directing all our energies to this object and inten-
tion in the Lord ; so that Holy Obedience may be perfect in us
in every point, in execution, in will, in intellect ; doing whatever
is enjoined us with all celerity, with spiritual joy and per-
severance ; persuadinq ourselves that ever-ytlu‘nq is just ; suppress-
ἕης every repuqnant thouqht and judyment qf our own in α certain
Obedience, and that moreover in all things which are determined
by the Superior, wherein it cannot be defined (as is said) that
any kind of sin appears, And let every one persuade himself,
that they who live under Obedience should permit themselves to
be moved and directed under divine Providence by their Su-

reverence to their Superiors (and especially in the inner man)
to consider and revere Iesus Christ in them, to love them sin-
cerely as fathers in Him‚ and so to proceed in the spirit of
charity in all things as to conceal no externa] or internal
matter from them; but rather wish them entirely to know
everything, thereby the better to direct them in the way of
safety and perfection. And for this reason, all, as well Professed
as Coadjutors once a year (and oftener if the Superior sees fit)
should be ready to open their consciences to the same person in
confession, either secretly or in any other way, by reason of its
great utility (as is set forth in the Examen) and also to make a
general confession, which should commence from the last general
confession, to him whom the Superior shall substitute for himself.

3 All should inform their Superior what things appear to be desirable
for themselves: and let no private person, without his permission
and approbation seek or cause to be sought any favour for his
