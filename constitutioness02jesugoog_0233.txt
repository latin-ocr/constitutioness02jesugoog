best qualified for the office; and the votes shall be gathered
into the hands of the Secretary3 then from every one of those
present in congregation, apart‚ but in the presence of the rest
they shall demand his suffrage contained in writing, which he
shall give them with the previous oath. Then in the midst of
all, the Secretary shall divulge the voteS, giving the name only
of the person elected; and then, each number of votes being
compared with the rest, he shall be the General who has more
than one half of the votes : after which, he who first nominated
him, or the Vicar General shall ask the rest whether they assent
to him whom the majority has chosen; and, as they may
answer, he shall pronounce the Decree of the election, saying3
In the name of the Father‚ and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost; I. N. in my own name, and of all so minded elect N.
to be General of the Society of J esus, Which being done, all
shall come forthwith to do him reverence‚ and on both their knees
shall kiss his hand. And he who shall be elected should refuse
neither the election nor the reverence paid, remembering in
whose name he receives it. In fine they shall all rehearse to-
gether the Te Deum.

7 If there be no one who has more than a half-part of the votes ;
another method‚ that of compromise, shall be resorted to, three
or five out of all the electors being chosen (those namely who
have most votes for this duty) and he shall be Genera] to which
the greater part of these three or five shall incline, and he shall
be proclaimed3 and reverence shall be paid to him, and thanks
returned to God, as before said.

8 After the declaration, it shall be permitted to none to change
his vote, nor when an election is completed‚ to attempt a new
one ; and let him observe what is said who would not be looked
upon as the author of dissension and of the ruin of the Society,
and who would not incur the penalty of the sentence of excom-
munication pronounced against him, and other weighty censures

at the pleasure of the Society, whose union and perfect concord '

conduces to the glory of God.
