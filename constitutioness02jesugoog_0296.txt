These truths are stated here with a view of at once confirming
the assei-tion in the Sermon, and of awakening the attention of
the Protestant Clergy and people to'the actual position occupied by
their adversaries. Our engagement is an arduous one; for it
requires us to keep the middle path between two equally dangerous
extremes: to maintain liberty of conscience, and to excite attach·
ment for purity of doctrine, yet at the same time not to
give occasion or countenance to that irregular intemperate zeal
which threatens to dash in pieces like a potter’s vessel the veryl
frame and fabric of the Church. If we would preserve what is
left us of our Protestant institutions, we must be careful above
all things to have anion amonq ourselveS.

THE END.
