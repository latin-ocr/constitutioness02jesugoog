Lm* that suffice, which is set forth in the Third Part, of the
superintendence of temporal and externa] affairs of the Colleges,
in all that relates to the body. This however must be noted
with peculiar care, that the Scholars study not at seasons un-
favourable to bodily health; that they devote sufficient time to
sleep, and observe moderation in their mental labourS. So will

according to their particular devotion to fill up the hour, if not

and judgment of their Superiors to whom as in the place ‘ff
Christ they owe Obedience.

Others, such as those Coadjutors who have not learned to read,
besides Mass, may spend an hour also· in reciting their Rosary,
