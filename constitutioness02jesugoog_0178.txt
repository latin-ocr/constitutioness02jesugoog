THE CONSTITUTIONS 01⁸·

and the like matters ; or they may be bound to read them over r
lest through the constitution of our frail nature they cease from the
performance of them in forgetfulness. And several times every
year let all petition the Superior that penances be enjoined them
for neglecting the observation of the Rules3 that this concern may
be an evidence of that which every one should maintain for his

spiritual advancement in the path of God.

CHAP. ΙΙ.

As overmuch solicitude in those things which pertain to the
body is reprehensible3 so a moderate regard for the preservation
of health and strength of body to the service of God is com·

to be necessary for their food, clothing, habitation, attention to
duty, or other things, let all inform the Superior, or whomsoever
the Superior may appoint‚ observing, in the interim, two things:

is most conducive to the divine pleasure, and their own benefit.

honour of God, and His service, due regard being paid to persons
in the Lord.

As it is not expedient that any one be burdened with so much
bodily labour, that the intellect be overwhehned, and the body
