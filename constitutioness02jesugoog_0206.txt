WHEN any are to be admitted to Profession, the period of
probation being past, and the proofs and other things contained
in the Examen being completed, and the Society or its Genera]

for that purpose, the name of the person to whom he made it,
the day, mouth and year being also set down: and his written
Vows shall be preserved; that an account of all the particulars
