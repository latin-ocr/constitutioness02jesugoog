Hospinian, in the Historia J esuitica, published in 1619, gives a
complete abstract of the constitutions. They are quoted, with
accurate knowledge, in *the Catechisme des J esuites of Pasquier,

who died in 1615. They are also s‘et forth in the Historia J esuitica
of M. Ludovicus Lucius, Basle, 1627. Μ. Benard, the author of

the Histoire de la Compagnie de Jesus, printed at utrecht in 1741, “

somewhere made of an edition in 1599. The extracts from the
