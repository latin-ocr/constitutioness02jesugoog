‘chase 'and sale of all temporal goods whatsoever as well of the
Houses as the Colleges of the Society, and of raising and re-
deeming any revenues on the frecholds of the Colleges for their'

use and benefit, on condition that it may be lawful to acquit
himself of the obligation on restoring the money which shall

have been received. But the General shall not alienate nor ,

altogether dissolve the Colleges or Houses of the Society once ”

raised, without a general assembly.

6 Of such things as are left to the Society to dispose of at its
pleasure, whether they be real property, as a house or estate
not specifically applied or annexed to any particular College by
the donor3 or whether they be goodS, as money, corn, or other
moveables, the General may dispose of them by sefflng, or re-
taining, or applying to this or that place, whatever he shall think
expedient to the greater glory of God.

7 The Provincials, or local Superiors, Rectors and Commissioners
shall have so much of this power, as the General shall impart
to them. But the officers of Colleges shall not be corporately
assembled for acts of this nature.

8 As it belongs to the General to see that the Constitutions of
the Society be every where observed ; so shall it belong to him
to grant dispensation in all cases where dispensatiore is necessary;
which duty he will execute with that prudence which the Liqlat
eternal shall communicate, keeping in view the object of these
constitutions, which is no other than the greater service of
God, and the good of those who follow this manner of life.
And this is said as much of the trials of those who are under
probation, as of other things in which it shall be judged that
such was the intention of the framers of the Constitutions to
the glory of God and our Lord.

9 The General shall have all power in missions, in nowise however
opposing those which originate from the Apostolic See, as is set
forth in the Seventh Part. He may send all that are subject to
him, whether Professed or not, (whom he may resolve to send)
to any parts of the world, for any period, definite or indefinite,
as he shall determine, to do any action of those which the
Society is wont to exercise for the succour of souls. He may
recall missionarieS, and in short, proceed in all thinqs, as he shall
think will be to the greater glory of God.

He shall arrange the duties of PreacherS, Lecturers and Con-
