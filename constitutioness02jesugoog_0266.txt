and that of the carmelites, should remain on their ancient footing,
inasmuch as their institution was prior to the Council of Lateran.
And finally, he permitted the individuale of the orders comprised in
the said constitution, full liberty of transporting themselves and
their effects into any other order already approved; provided only
that no whole order or convent should pass with all their effects
into any one other order, without a previous and express permission
of the Holy See.

The other Roman pontifis, our predecessorS‚ followed the same

induced thereto by the general discredit into which the order of

reformatiss’ though this order had been approved by Pope Sixtus V.
who had distinguished it by particular benefactions and favourS.
