2 If the Founder should exact any conditions at all contrary to the
order and manner of proceeding usual with the Society, it may
be left to the consideration of the General (after hearing the
opinions of those whom he shall think most capable of judging
in such matters) whether it will be useful to the *Society‚ all
things being considered, with a view to God's service, which it
has proposed to itself, to admit this College, or not. But if in
the course of time the Society finds itself burdened with the
load, it may propose and determine, in a general congregation,
that such College be relinquished; or see that the burden be

maintaining and managing their temporal concernS, and provide
for the wants as well of the Building, as of the Scholars (who
reside in the Colleges) and of those who are under Probation

vfor admission, and those also who without the Colleges conduct
their affairs. The conduct of the entire administration shall
remain in the Rectors: so as to enable them to render an
account, whenever and to whom the General shall appoint ε and
