society was reduced to ask of him, that he would condescend to
ratify and confirm by his authority, certain decrees formed in the
fifth general congregation of the company, and transcribed word
for word in the brief of the said pope, bearing date September 4,
1606. In these decrees it is plainly acknowledged, that the dissen-
sions and intemal revolts of the said companions, together with
the demands and appeals of strangers, had obliged the said com-
panions assembled in congregation to enact the following statute,
namel ε

“ The Divine Providence having raised up our society* for the
'propagation of the faith and the gaining of souls, the said society
can, by the rules of its own institute, which are its spiritual armS,
arrive happily, under the standard of the Cross‚ at the end which
. it has proposed for the good of the Church and the edification of
our neighbours. But the said society would prevent the effect of

. these precious goods, and expose them to the most imminent

dangerS, {f ‘it concerned itself with temporal matters, aad which
relate to politic-al affairs, and the administration os yovernment .· in

' consequence whereof it has been wisely ordained by our superiors

and ancients, that confining ourselves to combat for the glory of
God, we' should not concern ourselves with matters foreign to our
profession: but whereas in these times of difficulty and danger it
1135 happened, through the fault perhaps of certain individuaIS,
⁴ through ambition and intemperate zeal, that our institute has been
ill spoken of in divers 1113555, and before divers sovereigns, whose
affection and good will the Father Ignatius, of holy memory,
thought we should preserve for the good of the service of God:
and whereas a ,good reputation is indispensably necessary to make
the vineyard qf Christ brinq forth fraite ; in consequence hereof
our congregation has resolved that we should abstain from all
appearance of evil, and remedy, as far as in our power, the evils
arisen from false suspicions. To this end, and by the authority of
the present decree of the said congregation, it is severely and
strictly forbidden to all the members of the society, to interfere iu
any manner whatever in public affaire, even though they be thereto
invited3 or to deviate from the institute through intreaty, per-
suasion, or any other motive whatever. The congregation recom«
mends to the fathers-coadjutors, that they do propose and deter-
mine, with all diligence and speed, such further means 35 they may
think necessary for remedying this abuse.''
