CHAP. VII.

RnoAnn being had not only to the progress of our own Scholars
in literature, but to the progress also of those not of our
Society in literature and morals, whom we have admitted· into
our Colleges to be instructed, let public Schools be opened,
wherever it may conveniently be done, at least for Polite Learn-
ing. In the more important studies, they may be opened with
reference to the circumstances of the places where our Colleges

exist, always keeping before our eyes what shall be most pleasing
to God.

In these Schools let that method be pursued by which the ex-

ternal Scholars may be well instructed in all that relates to
Christian Lem-mn& and let care be taken, as far as possible,

they may attend the Sam-ament of Conse-mon once a mouth, fre-

quently hear the word of God, and in short imbibe, together
with learning, morals becoming ChristianS. And because, in
particular subjects‚ there must needs be much variety, according
to the difference of places and persons, we shall not here insist
upon them severally: but this may be declared that rules should
be established in every College which shall embrace all necessary
points. And we may in this place recommend that the correction
which the external Scholars require shall never be withheld .-
only let it be administered by some one who is not qf our Society.

As it is peculiar to our profession to receive no tempor-al remune-
ration for spiritual services, in which according to our Institute
we are engaged for the service of our fellow-creatures; it is not,
expedient to receive any endowment of a College, by which the
Society shall be bound to maintain a Preacher, or Confessor, or
Lecturer in Theology. For although a regard to equity and
gratitude should stir us to attend with increased diligence to the
said ministrations which belong to our Institute3 yet in our
Colleges which have been founded with greater liberality and
devotion, no obligations or conditions shall be admitted, which
may derogate from the sincerity of our manner of proceeding,
namely to give freely what we have freely received; still, for the
support of those who labour or study for the common good of
the College, that endowment may be accepted which the charity of

· Founders assigns to the glory of God.
