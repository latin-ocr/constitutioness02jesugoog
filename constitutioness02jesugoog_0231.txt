whose absence will be least injurious to the Province: and they
shall set forth to the appointed place, leaving deputies m their
provinces, and all things duly arranged. ⁷

4 The Superiors shall moreover see that all who live under Obe- ’
dience to the Society shall daily recommend those who are gone
to the general Congregation most devoutly to God in their
prayers and the sacrifice of the mass; and implore that what-
ever is transacted therein may turn out to the greater service
and praise and glory of God' s name.

CHAP. VI.

1 11¹· the meeting is appointed for the election of a new General
to take the place of one deceased; as soon as all are assembled,
the Vicar General shall address them on the subject, four
days before the election of the future General, and exhort them
to conduct it as becomes the greater service of God, and the
good government of the Society: and besides this day, they
shall have the three following, to commend themselves to God,
and more maturely to consider, who of all the Society is best
qualified for this trust; and they shall take care to be informed
in this period of everything relating to the business, by those
who can properly instruct them: but they shall not until they
enter the place of election‚ and are confined within it, determine
in their own minds, whom they will elect.

2 Throughout this intervening time every one shall be bound on
pain of the sentence of excommunication being passed upon
him, to communicate to the Vicar Genera, or to some one of
the elders among the Professed, who shall communicate with
the Vicar General, if he knows that any member has aspired to
this office, or is even then aspiring, procuring it directly or
indirectly, or manifesting it by any sign. And he who shall be
convicted of such ambition, shall be deprived of his suth-age,
active and passive, as one not competent to elect another, nor to

be himself elected; for which reason he shall not be admitted
to that nor any future meeting.
