Christian republic. Indeed‚ this letter was rather extorted than
yranted, to use the expression of Gregory X. in the above-named
General Council of LyonS.

After so many stormS, troubleS, and divisionS‚ every good man
looked forward with impatience to the happy day which was to
restore peace and tranquillity3 but under the reign of this same
Clement XIII. the times became more diffie-ult and tempestuous3
complaints and quarrels were multiplied on every side; in some places
danyerous seditions arose, tumults, discorde, dissensions, scandals,
which wealreniny or entirely breakiny tlte bonds qs Christian charity,
excited the faithful to all tlte raye of party, hatreds, and enmities.
Desolation and danger grew to such a height, that the very
SovereignS, whose piety and liberality towards the company were so
well known as to be looked upon as hereditary in their familie&—

only one capable of assuring the constant repose of their subjects‚
and the good of the Catholic Church in general. But the unex-

As soon as by the divine mercy and providence we were raised to
the chair of St. Peter, the same prayerS, demandS, and wishes were
¹ laid before uS, and strengthened by the pressing solicitations of
many bishopS, and other persons of distinguished rank, learning,
and piety. But that we might choose the wisest course in an affair
of so much importance, we determined not to be precipitate, but to
take due time not only to examine attentively, weigh carefully, and
wisely debate‚ but a1s0, by unceasing prayers, to ask of the Father
