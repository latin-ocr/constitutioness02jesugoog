CHAP. VII.

Wmm the Congregation is occupied, not in the election of a
General, but in other important concerns, pertaining to the
state of the Society3 the confinement will not be necessary:
although care should be taken that the affairs to be treated of
be settled as soon as possible: but as that light by which it
shall be determined what ought to be decreed must needs de-
scend from the supreme Wisdom 3 let the sacrifices of Masses
be first offered; and let a sermon be preached in the place of
Congregation‚ and other places of the Society throughout the

are debated which shall be determined by that meeting, to
obtain grace that all may be settled to the greater glory of God.
Then when all have been assembled once or oftener‚ the General,
the Provincials‚ the Rectors and the others summoned to the
congregation shall briefly set forth in the presence of all whatever
shall appear to require attention, and the reasons of their own
opinions, after having duly considered and commended them to
God and our Lord; and when they have each given his opinion,
let them leave its substance in writing openly, so that those
who please may read it, and pronounce their opinion thereon in
the following assembly.

The business being discussed on all sides in one or more Con-
gregations, if nothing should be clearly settled either way ; by
the common consent of all, or almost all, let four of those pre-
sent in the assembly‚ and entitled to vote therein be elected,
(whom the rest shall engage to support) and they shall settle

‚it by the opinions of the greater number, and assembled with

the General as often as needful they shall decide everything
which is agitated before them. And if all· be not of the same
opinion, that shall be carried to which the majority shall incline,

and shall be received by the whole Congregation as from the
hand qf the Lord.

If the General have not strength of constitution to enable him
to take part in all these affairs, he may appoint another in his
place; and thus, everything being separately arranged, as seems
