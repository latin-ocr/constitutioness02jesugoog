too in cases where, being concealed, they give no offence to
others. “

3 Secondly3 if it should be considered ·in the Lord, that to
retain any person would be prejudicial to the interest of the
Society, which as it is a matter of universal concern, should
doubtless be preferred to the private advantage of any one who
is sincerely seeking the service of God. Such should be the
case, if in the course of probation any impediments or notable
defects concealed in the examination should be discovered; or
if upon trial it should be found that he would be very useless,
and that he would rather impede than aid the Society through
his obvious inaptitude · to its several duties3 and still more if
he should be injurious to it by the evil example of his life,
especially if he be unquiet and offensive to others, either in his
words or actions. To tolerate this would not be charity, but
the very contrary, in him who is bound to maintain the peace
and good estate of the Society entrusted to him.

4 Thirdly; if it should appear that it would be contrary to the
interest of the Society and of the person also about to be
dismissed 3 which as relating to the body may happen, if during
Probation, disease or debility be perceived in any one, by which
it is probable he could not advance in his studies according to
our Institute and method of proceeding in furtherance of God's
service: as concerning the mind3 when the probationer cannot
settle himself to a life qf Obedience, to be regulated according
to the Society's manner of proceeding3 if he cannot, or will not,
subject his own opinions and judyment ; or for other impedimentS,
whether natural or habitual.

5 Fourthly; if it should appear prejudicial to others who are not
of the Society3 as if the bond of matrimony should be dis-
covered, or of legal servitude, or debt of great amount, wherein

. upon his first examination he had concealed the truth. Any

one of these four reasons appears sufficient for judging it more

agreeable to God, that he in whom it is found should be

honourably dismissed, than an imprudent charity be exercised in
retaining him.
