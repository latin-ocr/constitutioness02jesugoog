and dissensions among the faithful, whilst they carry this our will
into execution.

Finally, we exhort all ChristianS, and intreat them by the bowels
of our Saviour J esus Christ, to remember that we have one
Master who is in heaven, one Saviour, who has purchased us by
his blood; that we have all been again born in the water of
baptism, through the word of eterna] life3 that we have all been
declared sons of God‚ and co-heirs with J esus Christ; all fed with
the same bread of the Catholic doctrine, and of the divine word;
that we are all one body in J esus Christ, of which we are mem-
bers; consequently it is absolutely necessary, that united by the
common bond of charity, they should live in peace with all men,
and consider it as their first duty to love one another, remembering
that he who loveth ‘his neighbour fulfilleth the law; avoiding
studiously all occasion of scandal, enmity‚ division, and such> like
evils, which were invented and promoted by the ancient enemy of
mankind in order to disturb the church of God‚ and prevent the
eternal happiness of the faithful, under the false title of schooIS,
opinionS, and even of the perfection of Christianity. On the
contrary, every one should exert his utmost endeavours to acquire
that true and sincere wisdom of which St. J ames speaks in his
canonical Epistle‚ ch. iii. v. 13.

Further, our will and pleasure is, that though the superiors and
other members of the society, and others interested therein, have
not consented to this disposition, have not been cited or heard, still
it shall not at any time be allowed them to make any observations
on our present letter, to attack or invalidate it, to demand a further
examination of it, to appeal from it, make it a matter of dispute,
to reduce it to the terms of law, to proceed against it by the
means of restitutionis ad inteqrum, to open their mouth against it,
to reduce it ad viam et terminos juris, or, in short, to impugn it by
any way whatever, of right or fact, favour or justice: and even
though these means may be granted them, and though they should
have obtained them, still they may not make use of them in
court or out of court; nor shall they plead any fiaw, subreption,
obreption, nullity‚ or invalidity in this letter, or any other plea,
how great, unforeseen, or substantia] it may be, nor the neglect of any
form in the above proceedings, or in any part thereof, nor the neglect
of any point founded on any law or custom, and comprised in the
body of laws, nor even the plea of enormis enormissimae et totalis
