nes, Saguntum, (Morviedro) Toledo, Viseu, Embrun and Palencia,
Masters of Arts, graduated in the University of Paris, and for
several years versed in theological studieS, inspired, as is piously
believed, by the Holy Ghost, coming from various regions of the
globe‚ are met together, and become AssociateS, and renouncing
the seductions of this world, have dedicated their lives to the per-
petual service of our Lord J esus Christ and of us, and of others,
our successore, Roman Pontiffs; and have already during several
years laudably exercised themselves in the vineyard of the Lord;
publicly preaching the word of God with sufficient previous license,
privately exhorting the faithful to lead a good and blessed life, and
exciting them to godly meditations; attending hospitals, teaching
boys and ignorant persons things necessary for the Christian in-
struction of man ; and in fine, fulfilling, with great praise, the duties
of charity, and whatever tends to the consolation of souls in all
parts of the world where they have travelled. And since they
came to this holy city, persisting in the bond of charity in
perfecting and preserving the union of their Society in Christ, and
promulgated a certain formulary of life, in accordance to what
they have by experience ascertained to be conducive to the end
proposed by them, and conformable to evangelical designs and to
the canonical sanctions of the Fathers3 it has come to pass that
the manner of life of their associates, contained in the said for-
mulary is not only applauded by many good men, zealous towards
God; but is also so much approved by some, that they desire to
follow the same. The tenor of which formulary is as follows, to
wit:

Whosoever desires to become God's soldier under the banner of
the Cross, and to serve the Lord alone, and his representative upon
earth the Roman Pontiff, in our Society, which we wish to desig-
nate by the name of J esuS‚ after a solemn vow of perpetual Chastity,
shall determine in his own mind to form a part of this Society

instituted to this special end, namely, to offer spiritual consolation ’

for the advancement of souls in Christian life and doctrine, for the
propagation of the faith‚ by public preaching, and the ministration
of the word of God, spiritual exercises, and works of charity, and
expressly, for the instruction of boys and ignorant people in
Christianity, and above all for the spiritual consolation of the faith-
fulin Christ, by hearing confessions; ¹and he shall strive to keep
God always before his eyes, and the method of this His Institute,
