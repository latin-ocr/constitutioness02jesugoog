We have seen, in the grief of our heart, that neither these
remedies, nor an infinity of others, since employed, have produced
their due effect, or silenced the accusations and complaints against
the said society. Our other predecessorS, Urban VII. Clement
IX. X. XI. and XII. Alexander VII. and VIII. Innocent X.
XII. and XIII. and Benedict XIV. employed without effect all

their efforts to the same purpose. In vain did they endeavour, by
salutas-y constitutions, to restore peace to the Church; as well with
respect to secular affairs, with which the company ought not to
have interfered. as with regard to the missions ; which gave rise to
great disputes and oppositions on the part of the company with the ’
ordinaries, with other religious orders, about the holy places, and
communities of an sorts in Europe, Africa, and Amefica, to the
great loss of souls, and great scandal of the people; as likewise

great inconveniencies and great detriment‚ both in our days and in ' ,
past ages; such as the revolts and intestine troubles in some of the. . .
Catholic stateS, persecutions against the Church in some countries of
Asia and Europe, not to mention the vexation and grating solicitude
which these melancholy affairs brought on our predecessors, princi· .
pally upon Innocent XI. of blessed memory‚ who found himself
reduced to the necessity of forbiddinq the company to receive any .
more novices ; and afterwards upon Innocent XIII. who was obliged
to threaten the company with the same punishment; and, lastly,
upon Benedict XIV. who took the resolution of ordaining a general
visitation of all the houses and colleges of the company in the
kingdom of our dearly beloved son in J esus Christ, the most faithful
King of Portugal.

The late apostolic letter of Clement XIII. of blessed memory‚
